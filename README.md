# Game Design Final Project

This is a top-down 2D shooter created in Unity 5.3. You control a space ship equipped with plasma blasts. To destroy other ships, you only have to hit the enemy ship once to destroy it. Be careful though, because it only takes one shot for them to destroy you as well. Your plasma blasts can also destroy their plasma blasts, effectively cancelling shots out. Use the asteroids around you to your advantage, you can push them around to shield yourself from the enemy's blasts. The level will restart upon the player's death.
